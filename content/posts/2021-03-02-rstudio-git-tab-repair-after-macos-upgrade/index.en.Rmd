## Problem

Every time MacOS is upgraded, RStudio would lost its Git tab.

## Solution

There are two things you can try:

1. You might need to re-accept the Xcode license, with:

```
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

2. You might need to re-install command line tools:

```
xcode-select --install
```
