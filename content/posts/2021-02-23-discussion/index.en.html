<p>The main function of the Discussion section is to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>answer the question(s) posed in the Introduction</strong></p></li>
<li><p>explain how the specific results support the answers</p></li>
<li><p>show how the answers relate to what is already known</p></li>
<li><p>suggest future research directions</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is not a recap!
There needs to be added value to the reader.</p>
<p>How should we start?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Interpret and support key findings: answer the question that you posed in the Introduction and highlight evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>If desired, restate study purpose or provide brief context first (&gt;2 sentences).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="drafting-your-paper" class="section level2">
<h2>Drafting your Paper</h2>
<p>What are your <strong>research questions</strong>/hypotheses? (How will you word them in your <strong>introduction</strong>?)</p>
<p>What are your <strong>answers</strong>? (How will you word them in your <strong>Discussion</strong>?)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Type <strong>the aim (questions)</strong> of your paper?</p>
<ul>
<li>We hypothesized that…</li>
<li>We tested the hypothesis that…</li>
<li>We asked whether…</li>
<li>To answer this question…</li>
<li>This prompted us to investigate whether…</li>
<li>To resolve this apparent difference…</li>
<li>We solved this problem by…</li>
<li>The purpose of our study was…</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Type <strong>the answer</strong> to “this question” (the aim of your paper)</p></li>
<li><p>Type <strong>the result</strong> that support the answer</p></li>
<li><p>Type <strong>the explanation</strong> of how the result support the answer</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Look at your “question” and your “answer”, how well do they align?</p>
<p>Have you used the same <strong>key terms</strong>? the same point of view (<strong>grammatical subject</strong>)? the same <strong>verb</strong>?</p>
<p>You should answer your question exactly.</p>
<div id="st-paragraph" class="section level3">
<h3>1st Paragraph</h3>
<p>Linking Introduction &amp; Discussion, answering the question exactly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Question: Does sympathetic stimulation increase norepinephrine synthesis in rat superior cervical ganglia in vivo?</p></li>
<li><p>Answer: This study shows that sympathetic stimulation <em>increases</em> norepinephrine synthesis in rat superior cervical ganglia in vivo</p></li>
<li><p>Answer: This study shows that sympathetic stimulation <em>does not increase</em> norepinephrine synthesis in rat superior cervical ganglia in vivo</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="middle-paragraphs" class="section level3">
<h3>Middle Paragraphs</h3>
<p>Discuss other important findings</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most to least important</p></li>
<li><p>What they mean &amp; strengthen of your belief</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Comparing/contrasting your findings with others</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a list of <em>similar findings</em>
<ul>
<li>This finding is consistent with that of Smith (2000) who…</li>
<li>In accordance with the present results, previous studies have demonstrated that…</li>
<li>These results support previous research into this brain area which links X and Y.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write a list of <em>contrasting findings</em>
<ul>
<li>In contrast to earlier findings, however, no evidence of X was detected.</li>
<li>This study has been unable to demonstrate that…</li>
<li>This discrepancy could be attributed to…</li>
<li>There are two likely causes for the differences between…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now try to the write out your findings in sentences
<ul>
<li>For sentence starters refer to <a href="http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/">Academic Phrasebank</a></li>
<li>Explain conflicting results, if you can</li>
<li>Give pro and con arguments for your conclusion(s)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Summarize and generalize where possible.
Don’t discuss every single result</p>
</div>
<div id="last-paragraph" class="section level3">
<h3>Last Paragraph</h3>
<p>Provide closure: write a one paragraph conclusion that summarizes your interpretations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Interpretation of key results (the answer)</p></li>
<li><p>Significance of the work</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to generalise to broader situations</li>
<li>Practical application</li>
<li>Theoretical proposition</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ensure your wording matches your level of certainty</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion (<strong>end clearly signalled</strong>), this study shows that desert frogs can avoid death by desiccation (<strong>interpretation of results</strong>) by maintaining a high body water content and water storage in their urinary bladder and by rapid hydration when water is available (<strong>key findings</strong>).
These measure may be employed in combination with behavioural adaptations such as burrowing and change in pigmentation to minimize stresses tending to dehydrate the animals (<strong>generalisation</strong>).</p>

</div>
<div id="language-features" class="section level2">
<h2>Language features</h2>
<p>Need to pay attention to verb choice: (1) attitude to findings; (2)strength of claim.</p>
<p>A very common structure in Discussions: <strong>main clause</strong> (with projecting verb) + <strong>that clause</strong> (with another verb)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These results <em>prove</em> the test material <em>is</em> more rigid.</p></li>
<li><p>Our results <em>demonstrate</em> X <em>regulates</em> Y.</p></li>
<li><p>It <em>appears</em> X <em>has</em> Y.</p></li>
<li><p>The presence of X <em>suggests</em> Y <em>may be stabilised</em> by Z.*</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main</strong> + <strong>That</strong> clause sentences, 2 opportunities to indicate the strength of your claim</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Main verb (choice of verb, tense of verb)</p></li>
<li><p>Verb in that clause (tense, use of modal or not)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to match strength of sentences with the strength of the data / arguments</p>
<p>In the <strong>main clause</strong>, which verb is making the stronger claim?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The results indicate/<em>establish</em> that there is a link…</p></li>
<li><p>Table 9 suggests/<em>shows</em> a greater response when…</p></li>
<li><p>The latest data question/<em>challenge</em> the conclusions of…</p></li>
<li><p>The results <em>validate</em>/support the hypothesis that…</p></li>
<li><p>The test results <em>create</em>/suggest a basis for…</p></li>
<li><p>Changes in X may have influenced/<em>distorted</em> the…</p></li>
<li><p>Figure 12 depicts/<em>clarifies</em> the relationship between…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>that clause</strong>, the tense of Verb could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple past tense: applies to your study only
<ul>
<li>It is possible that microbial activity <em>caused</em> some immobilization of labial soil phosphorous.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simple present tense: general condition
<ul>
<li>It is possible that microbial activity <em>causes</em> some immobilization of labial soil phosphorous.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is also possible to substitute the that clause with a Noun Phrase
<ul>
<li>Previous studies have demonstrated that there is <em>a positive relationship</em> between propagule pressure and the establishment success of non native species.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Softening claims, express probability by using</p>
<ul>
<li><p>modal auxiliary verbs (may, can, could)</p></li>
<li><p>adjectives (possible, likely, uncertain)</p></li>
<li><p>nouns (possibility, suggestion)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Distance yourself from the claim by</p>
<ul>
<li>using impersonal constructions
<ul>
<li>seems/appears to/that …</li>
<li>it has been said that …</li>
<li>it is believed …</li>
</ul></li>
<li>attributing the belief to others
<ul>
<li>in the view of some experts…</li>
<li>many researchers hold that…</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Weaken generalisations by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>using the verb “tend”</p></li>
<li><p>qualifying the subject (most, many, a majority of, certain types of, nearly all)</p></li>
<li><p>mentioning the evidence</p>
<ul>
<li>According to this preliminary study</li>
<li>Based on the limited data available</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>adding exceptions</p>
<ul>
<li>With the exception of…</li>
<li>Apart from</li>
<li>Except for…</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Use a weaker verb e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>leads -&gt; contributes</li>
<li>causes -&gt; is associated with</li>
<li>proves -&gt; suggests</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Academic writers often use more than one of these strategies when making claims, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This result seems to suggest that…</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the data, there is reason to believe that…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But don’t overdo it!
Excessive qualification leads to saying nothing.</p>

<div id="common-problems-how-to-check" class="section level2">
<h2>Common problems (how to check)</h2>
<p>The answer/interpretation of key findings is not provided in the first paragraph</p>
<p>No concluding paragraph is provided</p>
<p>The importance/ significance of the study is not clear</p>
<p>Results are repeated or summarised in the discussion section</p>
<p>Often too long and verbose or too short and underdeveloped.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-considerations" class="section level2">
<h2>Other considerations</h2>
<p>Give credit where it is deserved</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Methods/results from other studies added important elements to your study design</p></li>
<li><p>your work supports/improves upon work of others</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Be transparent about unexpected/results that disagree with others</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the differences, don’t pretend they don’t exist</li>
</ul>
<p>Acknowledge limitations/alternative explanations of your findings</p>
<ul>
<li>Preempt a reviewer’s opportunity to point them out</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="final-discussion-check" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Discussion Check</h2>
<p>Remember that you need to ensure that your <strong>Discussion</strong> connects clearly with the issues you raised in your <strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>the country where you began</p></li>
<li><p>your research niche</p></li>
<li><p>your statement of purpose or main activity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the first draft of the Discussion is ready, go back to the Introduction and check for a close fit.
If necessary, redraft the Introduction to make sure the issues of importance in the Discussion appear there also.</p>
