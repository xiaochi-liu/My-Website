<p>Scientific writing is storytelling.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What did you do?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did you do it?</p></li>
<li><p>How did you do it?</p></li>
<li><p>What did you find?</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Scientific writing is engaged rhetoric: not just tell but persuade!</p>

<h2>Writing starts with reading</h2>
<p>Writing is a process</p>

<p>Ideas come from reading. Your writing starts with your reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish good reading practice early</p></li>
<li><p>Read as if you are already an academic</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t take everything as “fact”</li>
<li>Read as if it is a discussion/dialogue with the authors</li>
<li>Your writing will be judged as you are academic</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Read with purpose</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/12/12/turn-your-notes-into-writing-using-the-cornell-method/"><strong>Take purposeful notes</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Take note and care of what verbs you use to describe the literature</li>
<li>The verb you use to describe someone else’s work indicates your feeling about the quality of the work</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://medium.goodnotes.com/study-with-ease-the-best-way-to-take-notes-2749a3e8297b"><strong>Cornell Note Taking</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>just chose the quotes or paraphrases or details you expect to include in your thesis</li>
<li>put key words, identify themes, or recurrent patterns</li>
<li>write sentences that summarise the page</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Reading: Look beyond the content</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What language devices and techniques are used to structure and present their ideas?</p></li>
<li><p>How do they use references to make their own stances and positions clear?</p></li>
<li><p>How are arguments signposted, supported, and developed across texts?</p></li>
<li><p>How do authors introduce the theoretical backgrounds from which they are drawing?</p></li>
<li><p>How do they handle the literature?</p></li>
<li><p>What formal features are they using to scaffold their ideas and academic voices?</p></li>
