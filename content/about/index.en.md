Interestingly, after watching the talk, [_Your Public Garden_](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/your-public-garden/), given by Vicki Boykis on rstudio::global 2021, I suddenly got a huge motivation to build my blog website.
I'd like to record my learning experience in this blog, including the notes from workshops and courses I attended, solutions for debugging codes in R and R Markdown, and some other topics. 
Hope this is a good way to nurture my writing habit, and push myself to write, think, and learn.

Currently, I'm doing my PhD in Environmental Sciences at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. 
My research interest includes Geographical Information System (GIS), (Spatial) Machine Learning, Spatial Statistics, and applying these novel-fancy modelling techniques to solve the issues in Environmental Health & Public Health.

I work mostly in R and RStudio, and really enjoy conducting end-to-end data analyses.
Outside of work, I like playing the piano, hitting the gym, or practising kendo, in order to adjust my mind and get refreshed. 

This blog website is powered by the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package.
